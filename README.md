- 👋 Hi, I’m @betsybetsybetsy2021
- 👀 I’m interested in learning with snacks!  No seriously, I have offered to pay other devs and hackers in snacks for their good works in protecting what matters.  I have
- worked with a lot of Vietnamese tech people before and looooooveee red bean anything!  
- I am completely the stereotypical social techie.  Movie nights, game nights, hiking, hours at coffeeshops, way too much screen time, etc...
- I "grew up in tech" doing my college homework at company conference tables while my ex switched out their tape drives. I plan to make it someday doing something, so the 
- scene of me sitting at the conference table doing multivar makes it into screen history.  The company made health diagnostic kits for poop samples btw.  Fridges full of
- poop.  Let me tell you who loves the poop emojis... those guys!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science at FlatIron Online: Python, Pandas, SQL, JSON, Matplotlib, Seaboarn, Github, Conda, BASH, Jupyter Labs, Discord... 
- Gimme that fire hose because I'm thirsty!!!🚒
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .... well.  I am career transitioning.  I DO have lot of experience with government contracts, and technical writing.  I can beta
- test anything, but I will likely be learning more from you all at this point than the other way around.
