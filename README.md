- 👋 Hi, I’m @betsybetsybetsy2021
- 👀 I’m interested in learning AND snacks!  No seriously, I have offered to pay developers and hackers in snacks for their good works in protecting what matters.  
- I love food. I have worked with a lot of Vietnamese-American tech developers before and looooooveee red bean anything!  
- I am completely the stereotypical social techie.  Movie nights, game nights, hiking, hours at coffeeshops, way too much screen time, etc...
- I "grew up in tech" doing my college homework at company conference tables while my ex-boyfriend switched out tape drives. I plan to make it 
- someday doing something, so the scene of me sitting at the conference table doing multivar makes it into screen history.  The company made 
- health diagnostic kits for poop samples and had fridges full of poop.  Let me tell you who loves the poop emojis... those guys!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science at FlatIron Online: Python, Pandas, SQL, JSON, Matplotlib, Seaboarn, Github, Conda, BASH, Jupyter Labs, Discord... 
- Gimme that fire hose because I'm thirsty!!!🚒 I am a Montessori student - I am always learning different things on different levels at different times.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .... well... I am career transitioning.  I DO have lot of experience with government contracts, and technical writing.  I can beta
- test anything, but I will likely be learning more from others at this point than the other way around.
