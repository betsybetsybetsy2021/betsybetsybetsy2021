someone took the photos of my FAMILY

کناه بیبی به کردن کنیز است

I cannot learn Farsi other than vocabulary because I am not near ANY Farsi speakers and have not been since 2012.

Now someone stole my watch.  It doesn't work and you can't pawn it.  It was only important to me because it was given to me by my grandmother for my high school graduation. It has my initials on the back as well as the date of my high school graduation.  Stop punishing me for what other people do.  I have taken nothing from anyone, beyond a cucumber when I was starving.

My lip gloss emptied out. They are trying to reduce me to only jail supplies so I look like I am in jail or think I am a man using makeup. I think they are trying to use unaware orange box people that think they are helping to destroy my black box.

Still alive, but only on charity.  One day you will all realize you are either stealing from me, or retaliating against me for being 
protected by people you don't like.  Remember, I am a patchwork of all the people that have helped me, and some of them I dont' even really like, you aren't going to like all the patterns, but it is the person in the coat that matters.  Suspend judgement and let her speak.  I do NOT yield my time!

Annoyed... someone took my Hacker's Quarterly tote bag.

I had to sell my coding laptop for shelter which is why there are not updates to my repositories.  I have been unable to find new work in Los Angeles, most likely because I am not coded properly as the right kind of student.  I received one solar farm job offer that requires a license I cannot pay for, and likely the car that I didn't bring with me.  I prefer the Frosties, but I dont' have the backing.  

- 👋 Hi, I’m @betsybetsybetsy2021
- 👀 I’m interested in learning AND snacks!  No seriously, I have offered to pay developers and hackers in snacks for their good works in protecting what matters.  
- I love food. I have worked with a lot of Vietnamese-American tech developers before and looooooveee red bean anything!  
- I am completely the stereotypical social techie.  Movie nights, game nights, hiking, hours at coffeeshops, way too much screen time, etc...
- I "grew up in tech" doing my college homework at company conference tables while my ex-boyfriend switched out tape drives. I plan to make it 
- someday doing something, so the scene of me sitting at the conference table doing multivar makes it into screen history.  The company made 
- health diagnostic kits for poop samples and had fridges full of poop.  Let me tell you who loves the poop emojis... those guys!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science at FlatIron Online: Python, Pandas, SQL, JSON, Matplotlib, Seaboarn, Github, Conda, BASH, Jupyter Labs, Discord... 
- Gimme that fire hose because I'm thirsty!!!🚒 I am a Montessori student - I am always learning different things on different levels at different times.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .... well... I am career transitioning.  I DO have lot of experience with government contracts, and technical writing.  I can beta
- test anything, but I will likely be learning more from others at this point than the other way around.
