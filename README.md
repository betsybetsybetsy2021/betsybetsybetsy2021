April 2024 - TAP card stolen.  April 16 2024 Phone hacked but I am not eligible for free phones. I am not doing another first with the ones that didn't want me. I don't think I am in the right arches.  I worked for McCabe.

March 2024 - underclass students helped me get new glasses but people where I live them stole them from me.  No idea whether they tried to spin it as a theft but they broke my original glasses and I don't have health benefits so I can't get a new pair. 
They broke tge first pair, then when friends got me a new pair they stole them so now I can't see.  I am black 5 from NYC.  You keep trying to kill me on the blue line, but I am not even on a blue or silver line. They pretend I cannot, so they can control me.  i DID use survival Spanish in Quebec because I met Guatemalans there instead of French Canadians?!?!


"She don't want to be anyone else, she's a woman in total control of herself. It's such a wonder to be under her spell, a woman in total control of herself. Little miss kitty queen, she's got tricks up her sleeve, but I got a few of my own.  Am I bad to the bone? if I get what I want, mama said it aint' no crime." - Devon Cole's "W.I.T.C.H"

My glasses broken because someone else wanted new glasses. I won't get new glasses, but they WILL.  Some people will treat other people worse than dogs. Romania State of UNDRESS with Hayley - human traffickers in Romania "these girls can be kept like homeless dogs".  I already lived through hell and was supposed to land in California for Kintsugi not to be buried under "nots" that are going to get me abused, you keep your problems, I have enough of my own. I am not here to take the beatings for other people.



Stolen from me overnight... my broken black phone, a package of Chinese tea and a bic pen... no joke.  

Had the woman in Trader Joe's say "It is still money" ummm... no I was never money. I have never owned more than a car, I invested $400 in stocks while I WAS HOMELESS and I have ONE NFT. I rowed crew at a PUBLIC High School and we only had a boat because we went door to door begging for donations. I have less than almost EVERYONE. I don't receive a check or a stipend.  I don't receive food benefits. 

Some WONDERFUL people, the Farmer in the Dell, the bee, space, documentaries, Ukraine, Anarchy, Water, Arctic Tern, Blink, Minty, etc... I am freaking honored.  If I ever meet any of you, I will be googly eyed  Do they know where I am? I am not so sure. We didn't have any plans... I was just told to go start a new life somewhere... you guys wanted me to succeed as much as real parents and I love you for it.  i keep workin' it! I really need someone to kind of teach me how to do my job though too.  That is the person I have been missing. I have big knowledge and never upskilled where it counted so that I could be planning rather than subject to plans. 

I fear there is no time to clean eyes and ears, but someone blocked my screen telling me how you knew what you were doing.

 


Photos were returned. Watch was not returned.

Now someone stole my watch.  It doesn't work and you can't pawn it.  It was only important to me because it was given to me by my grandmother for my high school graduation. It has my initials on the back as well as the date of my high school graduation.  Stop punishing me for what other people do.  I have taken nothing from anyone, beyond a cucumber when I was starving.

My lip gloss emptied out. They are trying to reduce me to only jail supplies so I look like I am in jail or think I am a man using makeup. I think they are trying to use unaware orange box people that think they are helping to destroy my black box.

Still alive, but only on charity.  One day you will all realize you are either stealing from me, or retaliating against me for being 
protected by people you don't like.  Remember, I am a patchwork of all the people that have helped me, and some of them I dont' even really like, you aren't going to like all the patterns, but it is the person in the coat that matters.  Suspend judgement and let her speak.  I do NOT yield my time!

There are things that are surviveable, that death is still preferable to. - Me 8/4/2023

Annoyed... someone took my Hacker's Quarterly tote bag.

I had to sell my coding laptop for shelter which is why there are not updates to my repositories.  I have been unable to find new work in Los Angeles, most likely because I am not coded properly as the right kind of student.  I received one solar farm job offer that requires a license I cannot pay for, and likely the car that I didn't bring with me.  I prefer the Frosties, but I dont' have the backing.  

- 👋 Hi, I’m @betsybetsybetsy2021
- 👀 I’m interested in learning AND snacks!  No seriously, I have offered to pay developers and hackers in snacks for their good works in protecting what matters.  
- I love food. I have worked with a lot of Vietnamese-American tech developers before and looooooveee red bean anything!  
- I am completely the stereotypical social techie.  Movie nights, game nights, hiking, hours at coffeeshops, way too much screen time, etc...
- I "grew up in tech" doing my college homework at company conference tables while my ex-boyfriend switched out tape drives. I plan to make it 
- someday doing something, so the scene of me sitting at the conference table doing multivar makes it into screen history.  The company made 
- health diagnostic kits for poop samples and had fridges full of poop.  Let me tell you who loves the poop emojis... those guys!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science at FlatIron Online: Python, Pandas, SQL, JSON, Matplotlib, Seaboarn, Github, Conda, BASH, Jupyter Labs, Discord... 
- Gimme that fire hose because I'm thirsty!!!🚒 I am a Montessori student - I am always learning different things on different levels at different times.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .... well... I am career transitioning.  I DO have lot of experience with government contracts, and technical writing.  I can beta
- test anything, but I will likely be learning more from others at this point than the other way around.
